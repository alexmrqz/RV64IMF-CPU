# RV64IMF  CPU 
## An Implementation and Optimization Case Study
This project implements a single-cycle RISC-V CPU core (RV64IMF) in Verilog RTL with full simulation and verification. Itâ€™s structured in two phases. Phase one is a baseline RTL implementation using standard synthesizable modules and automated tool flows. Phase two replaces select modules with custom-optimized versions, including layout where applicable. The goal is to evaluate the tradeoffs between design automation and hand-tuned hardware in terms of area, power, timing, and development effort. This is both a learning project and a way to demonstrate practical VLSI design skills across the full stack.
